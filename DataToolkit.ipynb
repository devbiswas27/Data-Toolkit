        "\n",
        "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental open-source library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why NumPy is Widely Used\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key reasons for its popularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Powerful N-dimensional Array Object (ndarray)\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy’s ndarray is a fast, flexible container for large datasets in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "It enables vectorized operations, avoiding the need for explicit loops in many cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is implemented in C and optimized for performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be orders of magnitude faster than pure Python, especially for large data operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Broadcasting Capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes intelligently without the need for manual replication of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Extensive Collection of Mathematical Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Includes linear algebra, statistical, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Foundation for Other Libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "Many popular data science and machine learning libraries (like Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch) use NumPy arrays internally.\n",

        "If the shapes can be aligned, NumPy broadcasts the smaller array to match the larger one.\n",
